Perhaps you're confused as to where to start, or you believe your coding skills aren't "good enough"? Don't worry if you are here then you have what it takes to contribute.

Here are some ways you can contribute to the Real World DAP project:

- Spread the word! Blog, post, and chat about the project to attract people -- our group of contributers should be well rounded

- Create documentation (very important! We would be eternally grateful)
